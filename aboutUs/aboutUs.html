            Chris full stack developer "I'm an Englishman living in Paris since
            2016. I've always been very green and try to limit my intake of meat
            and dairy products due to their negative impact on the environment.
            I enjoy spending my holidays catching some sun on the beach but also
            strolling through forests where there's the best air. I joined The
            Holiday Helpers to assist those who search ecologically sound
            holiday destinations."

            Assétou full stack developer "I was born in Brittany. I wanted to
            get involved in ecology during a trip to Bali. Despite a magical
            trip, I discovered a lot of waste linked to mass tourism which was
            not mastered. I realized that traveling was good, but traveling in a
            more responsible way was better. This is why I now make a point of
            carefully assessing my carbon impact for each trip I take each year.
            My contribution at Holiday-helpers is to continue to develop the
            site in order to make it as eco-friendly as possible"

            France for the past few years. With Chris we challenge ourselves to
            get the best Parisian expressions. I am passionate in ecology and
            love animals. I bring my backend and front end knowledge and
            organisational procedures to Holiday Helpers while enjoying drinks
            with my colleagues."
